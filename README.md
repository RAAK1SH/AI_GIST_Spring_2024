# AI Class Homework

This repository contains implementations of various pathfinding algorithms written in Python. These algorithms were developed as part of homework assignments for an AI class. The implementations aim to solve different types of graph traversal problems efficiently.

## Description
The primary objective of this project was to implement and analyze the effectiveness of different pathfinding algorithms in solving graph traversal problems. Each algorithm was developed as part of homework assignments for an AI class, focusing on understanding algorithmic concepts and their applications in artificial intelligence.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for Vacuum Cleaning Task:

* These algorithms were implemented to enable a vacuum cleaner to efficiently clean all dirt from a simulated environment. Both BFS and DFS were analyzed for their effectiveness in navigating a grid-based environment and cleaning designated squares.

- Bidirectional Best First Search for Finding Shortest Paths Between Cities:

* This algorithm was implemented to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph representing connections between capital cities. The bidirectional approach aimed to reduce overall search time by exploring from both the start and goal nodes concurrently.

## Usage
Each algorithm implementation is provided in its respective Python file along with detailed comments explaining the logic and functionality. These implementations were developed for educational purposes as part of an AI class homework assignment.
